# CSCI 2312: Messy Dynamic Array

Well class, it seems we've made our dynamic array, but at what cost? It's messy, it's full of commented out lines, and worse of all, it doesn't follow proper style guidelines.

As I've said in class, it's more important to get your code working than it is to keep it tidy unless you're working with other people, and now it seems we've reached that point of 'working with other people'. It's time to clean this code up, and get it working the way we want it to.

So, for extra credit, I'd like for you to take this code, and make it shine. Write comments that describe the functions, write tests to see if it actually works the way we want it to, and most of all, identify when it doesn't work and fix it. Do this, let me know what you did, and the points will be yours.

Good luck, you'll need it, as the code is very messy.
